# Overview
Here at Pragmatic Penguin, we strive to be a trusted source of information for new users seeking to begin their Linux education. Our goal is to make users feel comfortable approaching the daunting subject that is learning Linux. We try to present our material in an organized, easy-to-follow fashion that guides users through the step-by-step basics of getting into Linux and setting up Linux Mint. We want those who have no previous understanding of Linux to be able to arrive at our site, and leave with a fully installed and potentially even customized Linux distro! Whether their interest is personal or professional, Pragmatic Penguin seeks to aide users in all aspects of becoming acclimated with Linux.

# Competitive Analysis
## Site A
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/index.htm 

Strength: robust navigation system that allows for a guided experience and an easy way to find what you're looking for. The content is easy to follow well spaced out and separated by visuals to make things easier to understand.

Weaknesses: Lots of wasted space on the left and right side and a poor search function

## Site B

https://realpython.com/python-beginner-tips/

Weakness: The headings can be a little misleading and hard to understand.

Strength: The linear steps given to understanding the language aren’t too heavy on terminology.

## Site C
https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp
Strengths: Good color and design choices, follows CRAP principles well. Top and side bars’ navigation is intuitive and clear on where you are. Not much wasted space. The in-page exercises and ‘do it yourself’ sections are really helpful for visualizing things.
Weaknesses: Poor searching function, and very few in-page links. Can overwhelm the user with having to open several tabs on a very similar subject.

# Conclusion
Our mission at Pragmatic Penguin is to guide users on their journey into the Linux universe. We seek to ignite a passion within our users to carry them on to learn more about Linux and become experienced Linux users. Looking forward, we seek to build this site to be both easy to navigate and informative, leaving users comfortable with Linux basics and hungry for more. Some challenges we are prepared for include the ability to make the site user-friendly. We’re tackling this challenge by providing a glossary page as well as in-line definitions for key words and phrases that may not be implicitly understood by the layman. We hope to become a go-to source for beginners Linux knowledge!
