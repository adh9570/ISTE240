        In Linux, everything is a file. If it's not a file then it is a process. It is important to note that there
        are different types of files in Linux, but it is an accepted generalization to refer to them all as files. 
        A Linux system, just like a Unix system, makes no difference between a file or a directory. A directory is 
        just a file, containing multiple names of other files. Programs, services, text, images, and so on, are all 
        considered files in Linux. In order to keep track of all these files it's easier to think of them in a tree-like 
        structure. In Linux there are no drive letters. This is because the files are not ties to one particular hard drive 
        location. Hard drives are simply known as /dev/sda or /dev/sdb.
