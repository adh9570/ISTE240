            In Linux, everything is a file. If it's not a file then it is a process. It is important to note that there
            are different types of files in Linux, but it is an accepted generalization to refer to them all as files. 
            A Linux system, just like a Unix system, makes no difference between a file or a directory. A directory is 
            just a file, containing multiple names of other files. Programs, services, text, images, and so on, are all 
            considered files in Linux. In order to keep track of all these files it's easier to think of them in a tree-like 
            structure. In Linux there are no drive letters. This is because the files are not ties to one particular hard drive 
            location. Hard drives are simply known as /dev/sda or /dev/sdb.<br><br>

        <p>The following list contains some common directories in Linux. This can prove to be useful when trying to find a file or location to
            store a specific file.

        <ul><!--Start the list for the common directories and meaning-->
            <li>*/: Root directory (Based off of the file system)</li>
            <li>/bin: Executable programs</li>
            <li>/boot: Linux kernel and boot loader</li>
            <li>/dev: Special device files</li>
            <li>/etc: System configuration files</li>
            <li>/home: Home directories of all users</li>
            <li>/lib: Library files for programs</li>
            <li>/media: Mount points for CD-ROM and other media</li>
            <li>*/tmp: Temporary directory</li>

    <div id="permissions">
        <p>The following list contains some different various of file permissions you may encounter. </p>

        <!--Start list for permissions-->
        <ul>
            <li>rwxrwxrwx: Three sets of rwx. The leftmost set pertains to the owner, the middle set is for the group, and the rightmost set 
                is for others; rwx stands for read (r), write (w), execute (x); the dash (–) means no permission.
            </li>
            <li>rwx——: Only the owner can read, write, and execute</li>
            <li>rw——-: Only the owner can read and write.</li>
            <li>r–r–r–: Everyone can read.</li>
            <li>Permissions can also be expressed numerically, where read (r) is equal to 4, write (w) is equal to 2, execute (x) is equal 
                to 1, and no permission is equal to 0. Therefore, rwxrwxrwx is equal to 777, rwx—— is equal to 700, rw-r–r— is equal to 644, 
                rw——- is equal to 600, and r–r–r— is equal to 444.
            </li>
