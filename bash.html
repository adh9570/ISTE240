    <h1>Bash Shell Introduction</h1>
    <div id="bashintro">
    <p> 
        Now that you've gotten your Linux all set up and running,
        A black window called a Terminal should appear on
        your screen. containing a blinking cursor following the words:
        <strong>root@localhost:~#</strong>
        <img src="bashshell.jpg" alt="Bash Shell image">
    </p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="bashsections">
    <h1>What Does The Bash Shell Show?</h1>
        <p>
            This entire window is known as the shell prompt
            This is the way your terminal informs you that it is available to input the next command
            The shell prompt is split into different sections that help you identify certain information.
            <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>root:</strong>       
            </li>

                <div id="bashpart">
                    <img src="bashshell.jpg" alt="Bash Shell image">
                </div>

                <p>
                    This is your username, the name of your administration account after Linux is installed.
                    However, other accounts that are logged in to the Linux system but without the administration authorization, the
                    root will instead display <strong>\$</strong>.
                </p>    
            

            <li>
                <strong>localhost:</strong>
            </li>

                <div id="bashpart">
                    <img src="bashshell.jpg" alt="Bash Shell image">
                </div>

                <p>
                    Here is your Linux distributionâ€™s hostname.the hostname is the name your 
                    distribution gives itself, but also the port your Linux will connect to. (Unless connected to a 
                    server/ip, localhost will always be displayed as the hostname)
                </p>

            <li>
                <strong>~:</strong>
            </li>

                <div id="bashpart">
                    <img src="bashshell.jpg" alt="Bash Shell image">
                </div>

                <p>
                    Following the colon is the name of the directory that you are currently in. directories
                    are the folders your Bash Shell is currently looking in. If on Windows or MacOS, this is essentially the same
                    as opening the Desktop, the documents folder, or any other folders on your computer.
                </p>
            
            <li>
                <strong>~</strong>
            </li>

                <div id="bashpart">
                    <img src="bashshell.jpg" alt="Bash Shell image">
                </div>

                <p>
                    On first log in, the Bash Shell will always be inside the home directory. To show that you
                    are in the home directory, the tilde (~) before the colon is a shortcut for the path of the home directory.
                </p>

            <li>
                <strong>#</strong>
            </li>

                <div id="bashpart">
                    <img src="bashshell.jpg" alt="Bash Shell image">
                </div>

                <p>
                    The pound punctuation (#) marks the end of the shell prompt text. If you enter in a command,
                    the start of your command will appear after the #. Any valid Linux shell command can be entered at the blinking cursor.
                </p>
            
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="bashcommands">
        <h1>Some Starting Commands</h1>

        <p>
            There are a lot of commands to use in Linux, but there are some that you want to learn before anything else.
            With these, you will be able to navigate and create new files and directories on your PC.

            cd (directory name)
            <div id="bashpart">
                <img src="bashshell.jpg" alt="Bash Shell image">
            </div>
            this command lets you move from one directory to another. However, when changing between directories, you have to remember
            to type the entire directory. For example, a folder called preset on your desktop would have the directory of desktop/preset.
            Inputting just cd will bring you to the root directory.

            mkdir (new directory name)
            <div id="bashpart">
                <img src="bashshell.jpg" alt="Bash Shell image">
            </div>
            The mkdir command will create a new directory(folder) in whichever directory the user has placed themself in.
            Pwd prints the current directory
            Cd takes you to the root directory
            Ls lists everything inside your current directory
            
        </p>
    </div>
