                    Now that you've gotten your Linux all set up and running,
                    A black window called a Terminal should appear on
                    your screen. containing a blinking cursor following the words:
                    <strong>root@localhost:~#</strong>

                        This entire window is known as the shell prompt
                        This is the way your terminal informs you that it is available to input the next command
                        The shell prompt is split into different sections that help you identify certain information.

                                However, other accounts that are logged in to the Linux system but without the administration authorization, the

                                server/ip, localhost will always be displayed as the hostname)

                                are the folders your Bash Shell is currently looking in. If on Windows or MacOS, this is essentially the same
                                as opening the Desktop, the documents folder, or any other folders on your computer.

                                On first log in, the Bash Shell will always be inside the home directory. To show that you
                                are in the home directory, the tilde (~) before the colon is a shortcut for the path of the home directory.

                                The pound punctuation (#) marks the end of the shell prompt text. If you enter in a command,

                <p>
                    There are a lot of commands to use in Linux, but there are some that you want to learn before anything else.
                    With these, you will be able to navigate and create new files and directories on your PC.
                </p>
                <p>

                    <strong>cd (directory name)</strong>
                    <div id="bashpart">
                        <img src="./assets/media/cd.png" alt="Bash Shell image">
                    </div>
                    This command lets you move from one directory to another. However, when changing between directories, you have to remember
                    to type the entire directory. For example, a folder called preset on your desktop would have the directory of desktop/preset.
                    Inputting just cd will bring you to the root directory.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>mkdir (new directory name) rmdir (directory name)</strong>
                    <div id="bashpart">
                        <img src="./assets/media/mkdir.png"" alt="Bash Shell image">
                    </div>
                    The mkdir command will create a new directory(folder) in whichever directory the user has placed themself in.
                     In parallel, <strong>rmdir</strong> is the command used to delete a directory. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>pwd</strong>
                    <div id="bashpart">
                        <img src="./assets/media/pwd.png" alt="Bash Shell image">
                    </div>
                    Pwd prints the current directory that you are in. So for example, if you are in the folder preset on your desktop,
                    entering the pwd command will show Desktop/Preset.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>ls</strong>

                    </div>
                    The ls command will list every file, folder, or program that is inside your current directory. This is very useful to 
                    help you figure out where a file may be if you know the name of it, or if you aren't sure if you are in the right directory 
                    with everything you're looking for.
                    
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>touch (file)</strong>
                    <div id="bashpart">

                    </div>
                    The touch command allows you to create a file inside the directory you are currently in. It can create any empty file
                    such as a .txt file or an empty .zip file.
                    
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>rm (directory / file name) / rm -r (directory name)</strong>

                    </div>
                    Deleting files on linux is as simple as rm followed by the file or directory name. if you wanna delete a directory and all
                    the files contained inside, <strong>rm (directory name)</strong>. However, if you want to just delete the directory without wiping the files
                    as well, <strong>rm -r (directory name)</strong> will delete the directory but move all the files into whichever directory you are currently in.
                    
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>mv (filename) (new name)</strong>
                    <div id="bashpart">
                        <img src="./assets/media/mv.png" alt="Bash Shell image">
                    </div>
                    The mv command can be used to change a file or directory name. Just input the original file name first followed by the new name you
                    wish to input and you're done! 

                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>cp</strong>

                    </div>
                    The cp command will let you copy a file into a different directory within the command line. Taking two inputs, cp requires the name of the file
                    in the directory that you are in, followed by the directory that you wish to copy it to.
                </p>

                    <strong>man & --help</strong>

                    </div>
                    If you wanna learn more about a command that you don't normally use or don't fully understand, enter the man command followed by
                    the command that you don't understand. For example, typing <strong>man cd</strong> will show the manual pages for the cd command. Or, you can type
                    the command name followed by <strong>-help</strong> to see the same manual pages.
                    
                </p>

                <p>

                    </div>
                    If you can't remember the name of a file or where you saved it, the locate command is a nifty command to find your file. If
                    you know a word or two contained inside the document, you can find the file with just that! By using the -i argument along with
                    the command, you ignore the case of the text (uppercase or lowercase). So, if you're looking for a file that you know contains the word
                    "amazing", you type <strong>locate -i amazing</strong>. If you know more than one word, just add asterisks between the words. That would look like
                    <strong>locate -i *amazing*food*</strong>
                    
                </p>
    </div>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Pwd prints the current directory

                    Cd takes you to the root directory
                    Ls lists everything inside your current directory
