            <h1>Linux History</h1>
            <p>
                Similar to Mac Os X, Linux is based off of the Unix operating system.
                Unix was a system developed between 1965 and the early 1970’s by a research team at AT&T’s Bell Labs
                The research team focused on creating an accessible operating system for multiple users
                Unix was becoming more commonly used by the late 1980’s by different corporations.
                In 1991, Linus Torvalds released Linux kernel, a free, open-source software similar to Unix, but something that is now able to me modified (open-source)
                Linux is not the entire operating system, but instead the kernel
                Kernel provides the bridge between your viewing, the hardware, and the commands sent and received from applications.
                The Free Software Foundation provides the rest of the operating system, including GNU libraries, utilities, and other software
                As a whole, the operating system is known as GNU/Linux
                Before choosing Linux, figure out which distribution you would like to install. 
                Some distributions of Linux are similar to other operating systems such as Windows 7 or Windows 10, however changing between different distributions of Linux is not the same as upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 10, as they are considered “different versions” of the same operating system.
                Instead, distributions of Linux combine different bundles of applications and libraries to create a similar yet different “operating system”
