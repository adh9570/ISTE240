            There are a lot of Linux add-ons to choose from. The first is an office suite. Your Linux distribution 
            might actually already come with a free, pre-installed office suite. If not you can always download one 
            like libreoffice, which has all the features of a word editor. If you don’t like this you can always use 
            google docs. Another add-on to look into is a web browser. No doubt you already have your favorite or 
            preferred browser, but you are experimenting with Linux, so why not try a new browser like chromium, 
            or Midori. Another add-on that Linux brings to the table is your email viewer. Try out a different 
            program and finds one that best fits you such as Thunderbird, Evolution, or KMail. There are so many 
            add-ons available for Linux that we just can’t possibly list them all here! Check out the most popular 
            add-ons <a href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-linux-apps" target="_blank">here.</a><!--Link to take the user to a top 10 add-on site-->

            <!--Start VLC add-on-->    
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The VLC media player is exactly what it sounds like. A media player. It can do so much more than just play
                        video files you find and download. It actively finds and downloads codecs for unknown file formats and allows
                        you to play them. This elimiates future playback errors. This software also allows you to play a DVD or stream 
                        the video to another device.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Firefox is the pre-installed we browser in most linux distributions. It is popular because of is fluid
                        interface. You are able to play youtube videos right aaway, and can download extensions to do the same
                        with other video formats. It also updates on launch to ensure you are always using the most current version
                        available. As always, if you don't like firefox you can always download and install any browser you like.

                    <p>
                        GIMP is free image editor used to re-touch and customize images. You might need some time to adjust
                        to the interface if you like a different editor, but GIMP is well worth it. It can do everything a
                        high-end editor can do and supports photoshop plug-ins. An added beefit is that the software is 
                        less than 100MB! Great for conserving disk space.
